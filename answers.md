# PART1: Introduction to Software Engineering

# Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering: is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.
    - Software Engineering ensures the development of redundant software solutions that enable companies to optimize their operations, streamline processes and gain a competitive edge.


# Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. CHANGE ANALYSIS:
                - changes are assessed to determine the cost and the impact of the change to the system/software before implementating the change.

2. RELEASE PLANNING:
                - if the proposed changes are accepted, a new release of the software planned.

3. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION:
                - the new version of the system is designed, implemented and tested.


# List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. PLANNING:
        - the stakeholders outline objectives for the system and establish a blueprint of how thw system will function. 
        - they identify the resources and costs estimation to complete the project.

2. ANALYSIS:
        - the stakeholders generate a software requirement specifications (SRS) document. 
        - they evaluate existing prototypes and conduct market research.

3. DESIGN:
        - the system blueprint is created to highlight the end-product of the project.
        - prototypes are initiated to outline the system interfaces, databases and core features of the system.

4. DEVELOPMENT:
        -  the actual writing of code commences to build the system according to the finalized SRS document.

5. TESTING:
        - software is evaluated to determine whether the system functions as expected. 
        - testing ensures that the system fulfill user objectives and expectations. 
                - detect bugs, deffects and searching for vulnerabilities.

6. INTEGRATION & IMPLEMENTATION
        - the system is integrated and deployed.

7. MAINTENANCE:
        - release new versions (updates, patches, etc) of the system to improve it.


# Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL METHODOLOGY
                - ideal for the development of projects that have stable and clearly defined requirements that are unlikely to change.
                - unidirectional approach. Once a phase is completed, there is no turning to the previous phases of SDLC.
                - lack flexibility and adaptivity.
                - product delivery is delayed.
                - Exmaple:
                        - appropriate when developing enteprise applications like CRMS, HRMS, etc.

AGILE METHODOLOGY
                - ideal for projects that have unclear requirements.
                - change to requirements document is allowed enabling continous improvement.
                - flexible and promotes teamwork.
                - faster product delivery
                - Example:
                        - appropriate when developing a new website.


# Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER:
                - writes code and develop the entire software product. 
                - responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other stakeholders such as the desiners and quality assurance (QA) engineers.

Quality Assurance Engineer (QAE):
                - creates test cases/scenarios that identify issues with the software before deployment.
                - ensures that the system meets requirements before deployment.
                - responsible for creating/developing standards and procedures for programmers to follow.

PROJECT MANAGER:
                - creates blueprint for the project and discuss the requirements with clients and developers.
                - monitor the overall software development process.


# Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
                - enable dvelopers to track changes, commit updates and merge code efficiently.
                - Example:
                        - IDE (Visual Studio)
                        - VCS (Git)


# What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY:
                - software engineers must leverage tech trends in order to standout in a highly competitive market.

USABILITY ( challenging to develop a system that will cater various end-users preferences):
                - software engineers need to test the system thoroughly and monitor it in production and improve as required. 


# Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING:
        - checks a particular functional unit of code.
        - helps to identify defects related to safety, security and reliability ensuring higher code quality.

SYSTEM TESTING:
        - tests the complete and fully integrated system.
        - evaluates how the various components of the system interact with each other.

ACCEPTANCE TESTING:
        - final testing stage before software release.
        - evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements. 




# PART 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

# Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
PROMPT ENGINEERING:
        -  the act and science of crafting precise inputs to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant outputs.


# Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 
VAGUE PROMPT Example:
                - How to install git?

REFINED PROMPT:
                - How to install git in a Windows machine?
